Looking at the DataFrame, we can see the numbers of reviews for the reviewers part of the Vine program and who aren't. Non-Vine compared to Vine partners had a much greater amount of reviews of 135,483 vs 395 and five star reviews of 15,663 vs 48.Non-Vine reviewers had a slightly lower percentage of five star reviews of 11.56% vs 12.15%.

# Summary 
Concluding this data, there may be a slight positive bias towards Vine partnered reviews, however the difference in five star review percentages may be too small to have any statistical meaning. More analysis will be needed for a more results in terms of catagories, data, etc.
